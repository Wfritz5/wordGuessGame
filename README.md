In this game, I used Javascript, HTML, CSS and bootstrap.

This is a word guess game, where the random word will be displayed on the screen in characters "-----".
The user will then guess ANY letter on the keyboard to see if they can figure out the hidden word
There are allowed 6 incorrect guesses before a new word willa ppear on the screen, and the User will be tallied with 1 Loss.
If the user can guess the hidden word without using all 6 guesses, a Win will be tallied and a picture of the hidden word will pop up.
The game will reset, and the user can continue to play as long as they would like.

P.S. The hint is fruits...
